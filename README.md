## Add future update support

If you want to merge in future updates from this project and have your own origin,
set up a separate branch to track this.

    git remote rename origin jekyll-and-zurb
    git branch jekyll-and-zurb
    git branch -u jekyll-and-zurb/master jekyll-and-zurb

Then add an origin and push master

    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username-blog.git
    git push -u origin master

Now, the `jekyll-and-zurb` branch will pull changes from this project,
which you can then merge into your other branches.

## Updating

The `Gemfile` is using pessimistic version constraints for everything,
so if you want major updates, you need to bump the versions yourself.

JavaScript library versions need to be updated in `bower.json` and `_config.yml`.

If you update Foundation, but sure to update the version numbers in `Gemfile` and `bower.json`.
